# Disentangling the roles of cue visibility and knowledge in learning cognitive control
A task-switching paradigm classifying a word as either capitalized/lowercase or a consononant/vowel. Before the word appears on each trial, a cue appears for 11 ms, presented either subliminally (with a mask) or supraliminally (without a mask) depending on the experiment. Two of these cues precede a single task, and the third precedes both tasks.

## Organization
* The stimuli used in the experiment, two .png images and two .wav clips, are stored in the `stimuli` subfolder.
* The task script for all four experiments in this study is a single python file, `Script_all_Exps.py`. The script also includes the post-task for experiments 1 and 2. Entering the session number in the script's popup corresponds with the experiment number.

## Dependencies
The task script was written in PsychoPy [1.90.3](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/tag/1.90.3). See [here](https://psychologyit.uconn.edu/2017/09/20/instructions-for-installing-psychopy/) for help installing PsychoPy.
